# stupid-linear-actuator

Stupid (Not really smart) Linear actuator to help with moving things.

![Version1](./images/Version1.png)

STL files can be found in the STL folder. 

Initial version is based around 2020 aluminium extrusion. Other hardware:

    NEMA17 Stepper motor, 
    GT2-36-5mm Pulley, 
    Common microswitch 
    Appropriate length GT2 belt 
    2x M6x12, 
    4x M3x10
    2x ~M2.5 woodscrews 
    2x M3x30 or equivalent pins

Prototypes:
| A4988 Pin | MotorWire |
| --- | --- |
| 2B | Black |
| 2A | Green |
| 1A | Red |
| 2A | Blue |
    
A4983 is a version of the A4988 with onbord voltage regulator. Unfortunately it is discontinued and witll only be used on the prototypes for convenience. Future versions will require a buck converter.

# Buck converter

Not currently necessary  

# Homing Endstop

The addition of microswitch connected to the Weemos D1 Mini for homing is just a NC switch connected as a pulled up input to one of the wD1mini pins.

### Pin Numbering for Wemos in arduino IDE

If the driver doesn't want to install select uninstall and then install again. seemed to work

## Moving the stepper motor.

I've worked with the Accelstepper library before. So let's use that:

Install it into the arduino IDE in the usual way. Release notes would suggest that it just works, but lets see!

Yeah, this helps:

# Websockets on the ESP8266

This is the starting point, but essentially use the Websocket_LED example and change the html and javascript to suit the needs of the stupid actuator.

Future work will involve making things look a bit nicer. This will mean getting rid of the inline javasctipt in the html file and using the SPI flash memory on the esp8266 (4MB)
